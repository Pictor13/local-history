A [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) package for maintaining a local history of files.

## Benefits

* Every time you modify a file, a copy of the old contents is kept in the local history when you:
  * open the file.
  * close the file.
  * and/or loose focus.
* Available functions are:
  * file comparison of the open file and any of its older versions from the history.
  * incremental diff view.
* Functions are available via:
  * the right-click context menu.
  * the `Local History: ...` commands from the command palette.
* `Local History` helps you out when you change or delete a file by accident.
* `Local History` can help you out when your workspace has a catastrophic problem or if you get disk errors that corrupt your workspace files.
* Each file revision is stored in a separate file (with full path):
	* inside the `~/.sublime/Local History/` folder of your home directory (`"portable": false`)
	* inside the `Sublime Text/Data/.sublime/Local History/` folder of your [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) installation (`"portable": true`)
