# Local History
#### A Sublime Text 2 plugin for maintaining local history of files

## Installation
**With the Package Control plugin:** The easiest way to install this package is through Package Control, which can be found at this site: [http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)

Once you install Package Control, restart ST2 and bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows). Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list, then select `Local History` when the list appears.

**Without Git:** Download the latest source zip from [github](https://github.com/vishr/local-history/zipball/master) and extract the files to your Sublime Text "Packages" directory, into a new directory named `"Local History"`.

**With Git:** Clone the repository in your Sublime Text "Packages" directory:

    git clone git@github.com:vishr/local-history.git "Local History"

The "Packages" directory location:

* OS X:
    `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/`
* Linux:
    `~/.Sublime Text 2/Packages/`
* Windows:
    `%APPDATA%/Sublime Text 2/Packages/`
